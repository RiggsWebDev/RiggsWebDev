Hi! I've been a System Administrator for several years now. I've worked in the private sector, education sector, and have experience in the MSP space. 

What started as basic curiousity and simple scripting has lead me down a path of constant learning. I would eventually like to transition out of my current role as a System Administrator
 and move in a pure development role. 
 
It would be very exciting afterwards to potentially use both skillsets in some of type of DevOps position.

With all that said, it's a long ways away! So for now I'll be focusing on getting better and getting some daily use out of what development skills I do have! 

I'm currently placing an emphasis on learning the AWS space alog with Python, but there are a few open source projects I'm quite fond of (in particular- https://github.com/azerothcore)
that have forced to me to try and pick up new things along the way!
