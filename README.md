Hi! I've been a System Administrator for several years now. I've worked in the private sector, education sector, and have experience in the MSP space. 

What started as basic curiousity and simple scripting has lead me down a path of constant learning. I would eventually like to transition out of my current role as a System Administrator
 and move in a software development role. 
 
It would also be very exciting afterwards to potentially use both skillsets in some of type of DevOps position.
